# Form-Wizard-With-Multiple-Select-Using-React-Hook-Form
Created with CodeSandbox

This code is based on the awesome work of Bill Luo (BlueBill1049) & support team on React-Hook-Form 
and in particular the [Wizard Form.](https://react-hook-form.com/advanced-usage/#WizardFormFunnel)

I wanted to verify that data submitted via Select and Select (multiple) were functional to the little-state-machine stateStore.

This worked very well. Many thanks to Bill Luo and team.
